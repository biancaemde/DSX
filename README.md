Use IBMâ€™s Data Science Experience (DSX) and IBM cloud services to create a working cloud-based application from start to finish.  Participants will be led through a series of three labs that build upon one another so it is important that they are completed in order. A fourth lab will explore additional features of the Data Science Experience. 

1. [Lab-1](Lab-1) - The first lab will begin with loading raw delimited data into DB2 Warehouse for Cloud and interacting with that data from a Jupyter notebook in DSX with python.

1. [Lab-2](Lab-2) - The second lab will leverage Spark machine learning (SparkML) on the loaded data to create categorical predictions using pyspark and a supervised learning model and store the results back to the database.

1. [Lab-3](Lab-3) - The third lab will guide participants in creating an R notebook and Shiny UI in DSX using RStudio.

1. [Lab-4](Lab-4) - Time permitting there will be two labs to choose from for Lab 4. The first one features Watson Machine Learning, a point and click capability to build a machine learning model and deploy it. The second lab features the Canvas- a visual programming tool to create a machine learning pipeline. 

## Instructions:

### Step 1. Sign up for the IBM Data Science Experience (DSX).   We recommend using the Firefox browser.

__NOTE__: If you already have a DSX account, please skip to __Step 2__.

#### Create an account.

1.  Go to [http://datascience.ibm.com/](http://datascience.ibm.com/)

2.  Click the signup button on the top right

### Step 2. Create a project

1. Click on Projects > View All Projects to see a list of your projects.

3. Type a name for your project. For instance, "DSX Lab". A Spark service and an object storage will be automatically selected as well as a container with a default name. A container is a directory on the object storage. Click on Create.

 > You are now in your new project where you can create notebooks and data assets as well as add collaborators.
